# Trackr

Trackr is a productivity management application that helps users keep track of location where they are most active without any effort from the user save a click of a button.


### How to use

The application opens up to a home screen with options to start tracking, view tracking history or change settings. The default maximum time is 5 minutes, but this can be changed in the settings page.

After maximum time elapses and no significant change in location is detected by the application, the location, date and time is logged and can be accessed from the tracking history. Location history can also be viewed on map


### Libraries used to make this:

Trackr uses the Google Play Services API to get user's current location.
